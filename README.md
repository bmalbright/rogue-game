# RogueInReact Game

### This is a rogue like game created following a video course taught by Morgan Page through Udemy. 

### It's a very basic rogue game coded in React. Right now it is a single level game with the monsters not moving and where you can collect the healt potions but can't take them. Hoping to revisit this periodically and make changes but didn't want to get lost in building it all out now. 

### Upon starting the game, you are the '@' character in the top left corner. Use the arrow keys to move up, down, left, and right. Scattered throughout the labyrinth are loot, like coins, weapons, and health potions. Also throughout the labyrinth are monsters, among them ogres, demons, and dragons. You bump up against the monsters to fight them. The different monsters have differing levels of health to start with. If you have more health than they do, you will win the fight. 

### Future improvements would be to get the stairs working to different levels, and making those levels have different characteristics. The levels would get tougher the deeper into the labyrinth you go. Have an indicator to tell you which level of the labyrith you're currently on. The monsters would wander in the levels instead of being stationary. You could take the health potions to regenerate health instead of just collecting them. Maybe you get a count of the monsters you have killed while in the labyrinth. If this were a more serious game, there woudld be a way to save the game. 

### The game is deployed here:  [rogueinreact.netlify.app](https://rogueinreact.netlify.app/)
